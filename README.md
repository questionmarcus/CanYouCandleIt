# Can You Candle It?

:fire: :fire: :fire: *The result of 2 beginners trying to make a game in 12 hours.*:fire: :fire: :fire:

You play as Lumia, a little ember, who only wants to set things on fire before she goes out.
By traversing platform puzzle levels, you reach your goal and light: a candle, a birthday cake, and a fireplace! You can navigate the game by using the arrow or WASD keys and spacebar to jump!
